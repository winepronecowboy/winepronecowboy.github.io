I am struggling to decide on where I should focus this blog and, well, this site in general. Blogging is perhaps the most inherently navel-gazing writing medium ever conceived. And I have read plenty of first-time screenwriters' work.

Basically, I will need to base this website either around my life, interests, or opinions. Inherent with any of these choices is a belief or self-delusion that one's contribution is compelling, educational, or entertaining enough to justify monopolising a potential reader's precious attention and time. My insecurity in this regard is at times so crushing that I have been tempted simply turn this into a porn site. But even the thought of trying to impress digital deviants with my selection of smut feels me with dread.

I wrestle with the notion of anyone finding my writing compelling enough to make it beyond the first few words. Even writing for Twitter intimidates me. This all leads me believe that a blog and website centered around my neuroticism is the way to go. 

It is time to bring the medium's navel-gazing fomentation into full-blown angst territory by encouraging bloggers to use it as an expression of their most deep-seated insecurities. We can call it 'crowdsourced psychoanalysis' and develop apps. It will be like the 90s never ended but merely transformed for the smartphone generation.

I would pitch it to some venture capitalists, but why should they listen to me?
